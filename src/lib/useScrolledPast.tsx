 * "Has the visitor scrolled past this distance from the top of the page?"

 * a scroll listener — scroll handlers run on every frame of every scroll and
 * are the classic source of jank on phones. The sentinel is a 1px-wide,
 * absolutely positioned element that affects nothing.
 *
 * The consumer renders `sentinel` inside a positioned, document-flow ancestor
 * (SiteLayout does this) and reads `past`.

   * `opacity: 0` rather than `visibility: hidden`. Both are invisible, but
   * visibility interacts with enough observer/AT edge cases that it isn't
   * worth the ambiguity for an element whose only job is to be observed. It's
   * a 1px transparent span with no background and no pointer events.
   *
   * Degrades safely: if the observer never reports, `past` stays false and the
   * header simply doesn't compact and the sticky CTA doesn't appear. Nothing
   * is hidden by it, unlike a scroll reveal.
